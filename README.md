# Project-1---Netflix-Data-Cleaning-Analysis-Prediction.
This project explores Netflix’s catalog of movies and TV shows to identify trends, patterns, and insights into its global content distribution. The dataset spans titles from 2008 to 2021 and includes attributes like type (Movie/TV Show), title, director, cast, country, date added, release year, rating, duration, and genres.

Workflow

Data Loading & Inspection – Importing the dataset, reviewing structure, data types, and initial statistics.

Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing date formats, splitting duration into numeric values, and ensuring consistent genre categories.

Feature Engineering – Creating new features such as content duration in minutes and extracting release year and country insights.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Using visualizations to answer:

What is the distribution of Movies vs TV Shows?

How has Netflix’s library grown over time?

Which countries produce the most content?

Most common genres and ratings.

Top directors and content duration trends.

Visualization – Leveraging Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud, and Plotly to create bar plots, heatmaps, word clouds, and interactive charts for better storytelling.

Tools & Technologies

Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, WordCloud

Environment: Google Colab

Insights

Movies dominate Netflix’s library, but TV Shows have increased steadily in recent years.

The United States, India, and the UK are the top content producers.

Drama, Comedy, and Documentaries are the most common genres.

Ratings like TV-MA and TV-14 are most prevalent, indicating a focus on mature audiences.

Extensions

The project can be expanded to include:

A content-based recommendation system using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.

Machine learning clustering for genre-based grouping.

Interactive dashboards for dynamic filtering and exploration.

This project demonstrates the complete data analytics pipeline — from raw data preprocessing to meaningful visual insights — providing a strong foundation for both exploratory analysis and potential machine learning applications in the entertainment domain.
